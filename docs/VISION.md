# Cora - Vision Document

## 1. Project Overview

Cora is a challenge-sharing platform that helps people build discipline, track progress, and share their journey with friends. Users can join challenges and view their achievements — creating a space that mixes accountability with community.

## 2. Mission Statement

To empower individuals to take ownership of their goals by providing a platform that turns challenges into a shared, motivating, and fun experience.

## 3. Problem Statement

In a world increasingly focused on self-improvement — from fitness challenges to wellness routines and personal growth streaks — millions of people turn to apps and online tools to stay on track. But for those looking to **pursue custom challenges with friends or family**, the current digital landscape falls short.

This problem became personal for me when my mum and I tried to do a 75 Hard-style challenge together. We wanted a shared space to **track our progress, encourage each other, and stay accountable** — but we found ourselves scattered across text messages, spreadsheets, and social media. None of the apps we found supported **custom challenge rules, private journaling, or social features tailored for small groups**. We weren’t alone.

## 4. Vision

Cora is a digital hub for personal growth challenges, where simplicity and accountability meet. It’s not just an app for tracking and sharing progress — it’s a community designed to empower people to become better together.

Cora isn’t limited to fitness enthusiasts; it’s built for anyone who wants to build habits, stay consistent, and make measurable progress toward their goals.

- Clean and minimal UI for a distraction-free experience.
- Social but not noisy — focused on meaningful progress and journaling.
- Flexible and customizable — track fitness, habits, or any personal challenge.

## 8. Long-Term Vision

Cora aims to become the go-to platform for personal growth challenges — a space where people not only track progress but also connect, compete, and grow together. Inspired by platforms like Strava, Cora will evolve into a vibrant ecosystem where users share their journeys, celebrate milestones, and stay accountable through meaningful social interaction.

In the long term, Cora will expand beyond the app:
- **Community-Driven Growth:** Build a loyal user base that sees Cora as an essential part of their self-improvement toolkit — whether for fitness, wellness, productivity, or fun.
- **Event Sponsorship & In-Person Challenges:** Host branded events, workshops, and real-world challenges that bring the digital experience into physical spaces, fostering deeper engagement.
- **Partnerships & Integrations:** Collaborate with wellness brands, fitness coaches, and productivity influencers to offer curated challenges and exclusive content.
- **Scalable Infrastructure:** Support millions of users with a robust backend, intuitive UX, and features that grow with the community — from solo journaling to global leaderboard competitions.
- **Cultural Impact:** Position Cora as a movement — not just an app — that encourages discipline, consistency, and shared growth in a world that craves authenticity and purpose.

Cora’s long-term goal is to be more than a tool — it’s a lifestyle platform for people who want to challenge themselves and inspire others to do the same.
