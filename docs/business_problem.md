# Business Problem Statement
In today’s world, many individuals and groups strive to achieve personal or collective goals, particularly in areas like fitness, wellness, or personal development. However, the current tools available for tracking, sharing, and motivating others to achieve these goals are fragmented and often ineffective.

Specifically, individuals looking to engage in custom challenges with friends or family are faced with several key issues:

**1. Limited Customisation:** Existing platforms typically provide rigid, predefined challenge formats that don’t allow users to tailor rules and milestones to their specific needs.<br>
**2. Fragmented Communication:** Current solutions for sharing progress, like text messages or generic social media platforms, lack focused, goal-oriented structures for consistent updates, tracking, or collaboration, leading to disengagement.<br>
**3. Complicated Interfaces:** Many fitness or challenge apps require a complex setup process or are overly expensive, making them inaccessible or difficult to use for a wide range of users, especially those seeking simplicity and affordability.<br>
**4. Low Motivation and Accountability:** The absence of a centralised, community-driven space to see progress updates and interact with others directly results in poor adherence to goals. Accountability and motivation are often lost when users cannot easily share and track their achievements with others.

These pain points highlight a gap in the market for a user-friendly, customisable platform that allows people to create, share, and engage in challenges with their social circle in a simple, seamless, and motivating way.
