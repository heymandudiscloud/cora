# Cora MVP Scope

## Purpose of the MVP

The goal of Coraâ€™s MVP is to validate the core hypothesis:  
**People want a simple, social, and customizable way to stay accountable to personal challenges â€” and theyâ€™ll use a dedicated platform to do it.**

This MVP is intentionally lean. Itâ€™s not about building everything â€” itâ€™s about building the **right things first** to test user behavior, gather feedback, and prove that the concept works before scaling.

## MVP Feature Set

### 1. User Authentication
**Why:** Secure access and identity are foundational. Users need to log in to track their own progress and interact with others.

- Email/password login
- Third-party sign-in (Google, Apple) â€” optional for MVP
- Basic profile setup (name, avatar, bio)

### 2. Challenge Creation & Participation
**Why:** Challenges are the heart of Cora. This feature validates whether users are motivated to create and join challenges with custom rules.

- Create a challenge (title, description, duration, rules)
- Join an existing challenge
- View challenge details and participants

### 3. Progress Updates (Micro-Posts)
**Why:** This is how users stay accountable and share their journey. Itâ€™s also the main social loop.

- Post daily/weekly updates (text + optional image)
- View updates in a feed (chronological or grouped by challenge)

### 4. Social Interactions
**Why:** Encouragement and accountability are key to retention. This tests whether users engage with each otherâ€™s progress.

- Like and comment on updates
- View friendsâ€™ activity

### 5. Dashboard
**Why:** Users need a clear view of their progress to stay motivated.

- See active challenges
- Track streaks and milestones
- Quick access to recent updates

### 6. Privacy Controls
**Why:** Not all progress is public. Giving users control builds trust and encourages honest sharing.

- Choose visibility: public, friends-only, or private
- Control who can see your updates and challenges

## ðŸ§ª Whatâ€™s Not in the MVP (Yet)
These are valuable features, but theyâ€™re deferred until after validation:

- Group challenges
- Leaderboards and streak battles
- Notifications
- In-app messaging
- Event sponsorships or real-world integrations
