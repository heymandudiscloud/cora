# Business Problem Statement

In a world increasingly focused on self-improvement — from fitness challenges to wellness routines and personal growth streaks — millions of people turn to apps and online tools to stay on track. But for those looking to **pursue custom challenges with friends or family**, the current digital landscape falls short.

This problem became personal for me when my mum and I tried to do a 75 Hard-style challenge together. We wanted a shared space to **track our progress, encourage each other, and stay accountable** — but we found ourselves scattered across text messages, spreadsheets, and social media. None of the apps we found supported **custom challenge rules, private journaling, or social features tailored for small groups**. We weren’t alone.

## The Opportunity

- According to Strava’s *Year in Sport* report (2023), social features like sharing progress are a major driver of sustained activity — with users who engage socially showing 3x higher retention [^1].
- The global fitness app market is projected to grow to **$19.33B by 2029**, driven by demand for personalisation and social features [^2].

Yet, most challenge-based apps focus on **solo goals, rigid templates, or brand-driven events**, not **DIY social challenges** among real friends and families.

## Key Pain Points in the Current Landscape

1. **Limited Customisation**  
   Most apps offer predefined challenges with fixed goals, making it hard for users to create their own rules, milestones, or timelines.

2. **Fragmented Communication**  
   People often rely on disconnected tools (text, Instagram, spreadsheets) to share updates — losing momentum and accountability over time.

3. **Clunky UX and Overhead Costs**  
   Many existing tools are overly complex, behind paywalls, or optimised for fitness influencers — not everyday users who just want to get better with a buddy.

4. **Lack of Social Motivation & Accountability**  
   Without a centralised, goal-focused community space, users lose motivation and drop off.

## The Gap

There’s a clear need for a **lightweight, customisable, and socially-driven challenge platform** that makes it easy for small groups to create, join, and complete challenges — whether it’s 75 Hard, a journaling streak, or a “daily walk with mum” goal.

This app is designed to fill that gap — born out of a personal need, backed by real-world demand.
